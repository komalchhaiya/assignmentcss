• Question 1: Explain the CSS box model and its components (content, padding, border,
margin). How does each affect the size of an element?

The CSS box model that describes how the size of an element is calculated and how it interacts with other elements. Every HTML element can be considered as a rectangular box composed of four layers: content, padding, border, and margin.

1. Content
 The area where the actual content of the element (e.g., text, images) is displayed.
Effect on Size: This is the core of the element. The size of the content box is determined by the width and height properties set in CSS.
Example:
=
.box {
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
}
The content area of the element will be 200px wide and 100px tall.


2. Padding
The space between the content and the border of the element. Padding pushes the border outward from the content.
Effect on Size: Padding increases the overall size of the element. If you add padding to an element, the total width and height will increase accordingly.
Example:

.box {
    padding: 10px; 
}
This will add 10px on all sides of the content, increasing the total width and height of the box by 20px.


3. Border
 The line that wraps around the padding .  the outer  of the element.
Effect on Size: Borders add to the total size of the element. If you set a border, it will increase the width and height of the element by the width of the border.
Example:

.box {
    border: 5px solid black;
}


4. Margin
 The space outside the border. It creates distance between the element and other elements on the page.
Effect on Size: Margins do not affect the size of the element itself but affect the space between the element and its surrounding elements.
Example:

.box {
    margin: 15px; 
}
The margin will create a 15px gap around the entire element, but it won’t change the actual size of the content, padding, or border.



question2

: What is the difference between border-box and content-box box-sizing inCSS?
Which is the default?



 the box-sizing property tells how the total size of an element is calculated. By default, box-sizing is set to content-box, meaning that the width and height only include the content area, not the padding or border, which makes the element larger when padding and borders are added.

 border-box includes the padding and border within the width and height, keeping the total size fixed. This means that when you set the width or height, the content area will shrink to fit the padding and border. Using border-box can be helpful for maintaining consistent element sizes when adding padding and borders.

 he default value for box-sizing is content-box. This means when you set the width and height, it only applies to the content part, not including padding or borders.
