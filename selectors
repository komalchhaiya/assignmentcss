css selector is path for the specific part which you want to style in css. 
it can be done in three way :
   [1] element selector
   [2] id selector
   [3] class selector?
  
    element selctor :

    exa:   h1 {
    color: blue;
    }
    
    id selector:
    only one element specified with unique id

    example:
    #div1{
    margin: auto;
    padding: auto;
    color: blue;
    }

    class selector: 
    specific class name givem , where one needs to be used for more than one time.
    ex:  .class1 {
        background-color: yellow;
    }
    


question2
Explain the concept of CSS specificity. How do conflicts between multiple stylesget
resolved?
---
    CSS specificity is a used to determine which rules should be applied when there are multiple conflicting styles targeting the same element. 
   
    how conflict resolved:
    The rule with the higher specificity wins. Specificity is determined by a system that assigns weights to different types of selectors:

    Inline styles  have the highest weight.
ID selectors (#id) are stronger than class selectors (.class) or element selectors (tag).
Class selectors, attributes are stronger than element selectors



â€¢ Question 3: What is the difference between internal, external, and inline CSS? Discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

internal:

internal css is used when there in no need of much styling for huge elements set.
it is defined in heading part of code and used using style tag.
<style>
    h1 {
        color: blue;
    }
</style>


advantages:
  -- easy for small code. 
  -- keep html and css in one file only.
  --Does not require external file loading, so styles apply immediately.

disadvantages:
--Increases the size of the HTML file.
--Makes the code harder to maintain for larger projects.

external:

used for large code, external file is made for styling. and linked to html file
link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"
here styles.css will be file in which styling willl be done.

advantages:
--Allows reuse of the same stylesheet across multiple pages.
--Keeps HTML files clean and smaller in size.
--Easier to maintain for larger projects.

disadvantages:
--style will not be applied if link is not connected
-- might be slow

inline:
written directly into tag by using style attribute into that tag.
h1 style="color: red;">Hello World

advantages:
Applied immediately, without needing a separate file or style block.
disadvantages
-Increases the size of the file.
- not used for large project
- messy and hard to read
