<!-- Question 1: What is CSS Flexbox, and how is it useful for layout design? Explain the terms
flex-container and flex-item.

designed to provide a more efficient way to align, distribute, and space items within a container, even when their sizes are unknown or dynamic. It simplifies complex layouts by allowing elements to be arranged in a flexible, responsive manner.

Flex Container: The parent element that holds the flex items. It is defined by setting display: flex; or display: inline-flex; on the element. This container establishes the context for the layout and controls how its children (flex items) are displayed.
Flex Item: The child elements within the flex container. These items automatically adjust their size and position based on the properties set on the flex container and on the items themselves.


question2:: Describe the properties justify-content, align-items, and flex-direction used in Flexbox.

justify-content in Flexbox controls how items are aligned horizontally in a container. It decides the space between or around the items.
ex. .container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center; 
}


align-items in Flexbox controls how items are aligned vertically inside a container.

.container {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center; 
}

flex-direction in Flexbox controls the direction in which items are placed along the main axis. It determines whether the items are arranged horizontally or vertically, and in what order.

.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column; 
} -->
